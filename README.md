Scramble My Text
-------------------
This app takes text and does weird stuff to it.
Built initially in under two hours. (Twilio features added later)

It uses flask, [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for fun, and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) for visualization*. The app is deployed on Heroku [here](http://scramblemytext.herokuapp.com).

*Initally the app used the module in the app directory named 'VisGenerate.py'.
